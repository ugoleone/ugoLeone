# Ugo Leone

I'm a developer based in Bologna (IT) with a strong passion for coding, electronics, music, photography and (obviously) DIY.

I always try to interconnect different areas of knowledge with each other, in order to explore new directions.

In fact, I am constantly looking for new "projects to carry out" to test and expand my skills.
